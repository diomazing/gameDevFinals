"# GameDevFinals" 

This game is a basic Game Development using some basic tools in Unity(Student Edition).

This uses 2d Render Pipeline, Cinemachine Packages and some Assets taken from the internet.

The game revolves around a black slime that is trapped in a never ending loop of maze.

This game is supposed to only be an indie game that has no competitive platform built on top of the game. This is solely a single player game.
